Website has moved on to a new domain!  As I purchased the short domain for the dynamic DNS, it made sense to put
this website on that domain as well.  So the YAMS site is now available on [yams.in](http://yams.in).  Hopefully
the old URL ([richardbenson.githib.com/YAMS](http://richardbenson.github.com/YAMS)) is redirecting traffic here, but
it will have reset the shares.

Website is still hosted on Github Pages, just using the new domain.
