(I always forget to update here!)

Since my last post, there have been 2 new versions with some nifty little features.  I'm probably most pleased with the direction I have started moving the public site in and thanks to [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), it's [coming along nicely](http://i.imgur.com/5He6F.png).  Next up is to add some customisation to turn eatures on and off and put your own text in the "hero unit".

Anyway, here's the last few updates.
