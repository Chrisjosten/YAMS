# Yet Another Minecraft Server (YAMS)

YAMS is a vanilla server admin tool designed to make running a Minecraft server easier without changing the overall experience of playing Survival Multiplayer.  As it is not a wrapper, you won't have to wait for YAMS to be updated when a new Minecraft server version comes out.
